# DevOps
Devops is not a new tool/technology in the market.

It is a new culture or process to develop, release and maintance of the software
application.project/product with higher quality in faster way.

we can achieve by using automation tools.
## Types of Engineer
For any software two types or two groups of engineers will work

1. Development Group
2. Operations Group/Non-Development Groups/ Administrators Group

Again this classifiaction can be divide into small set of groups

1. Development Group:
--------------------------
The people who are involving in

1. Planninig
2. Coding
3. Build
4. Testing

are considered as Development Group

e.g.

Development People
------------------
Business Analyst(BA)
System Analyst(SA)
Design Architech(DA)
Developers/coders
Build Engineer
Test Engineers(QA)


2. Operations Group:
-------------------------
The people who are involving in

1. Release
2. Deployment
3. Operations
4. Monitoring

are considered as Operations Group.

e.g.
Release Engineer
Configuration Engineer
System Admin
Database Admin
Network Admin
etc

Devops is a combination of development and Operations.
The main objective of devops is to implement collaboration bet development
and operation teams

To Uderstand this new Devops culture, we havve to aware already existing SDLC Modesels
SDLC--> Software Development Life Cycle

- Waterfall Model
- Prototype Model
- Incremental/Iterative Model
- Spiral Model
- RAD Model
- Big-Bang Model
- Fish Model
- V Model
- Agile Model
- Devops Model or culture

1. Water Fall Model:
------------------------
Requirement Gathering/Collection
			Requirement Analysis
				         Design
					         Coding
					           Testing
						             Release
							              Maintenance
Also Know as Linear squantial Model

Limitations:
------------

 1. Development time will be increase
 2. Cost of development will ne increases
 3. It won't accept requirement changes in the middle.
 4. Client Satisfaction is very very low
 5. Bug fixing is a very costly bez we cannot identify bugs in early stages of life cycle.
 6. Not at all suitable if requirements keep on changing
 7. Not suitable for large prjects

 Advantages:
 It is very simple and easy to implement
 
 Best suitable id requiremets are fixed
 
 Best suitable for small projects
